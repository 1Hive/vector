# Welcome

Welcome to the Connext docs!

At Connext, our goal is to build the cross-chain routing and micropayment layer of the decentralized web. Connext sits on top of Ethereum, evm-compatible L2 blockchains, and other turing-complete chains, and enables instant, near free transfers that can be routed **across chains** and over liquidity in **any asset**. Most importantly, it does this without giving up the trust-minimization properties of the underlying chain.

You can think of Connext as a shared standard for blockchains and other decentralized networks to communicate with each other about value.

## Where Do I Start?

- If you're building a browser dApp, check out the browser-node quick start guide.
- If you're building a p2p network that uses programmable micropayments, you likely want to run a router


- If you're building a p2p network on top of Connext, you likely want a combination of node and router docs.
- etc.

If you're still confused about where to begin, join us in our community chat! We're **very** responsive and happy to point you to the right resources. :)
