Misc naming suggestions:
 - Calling this protocol `vector` implies that our channels are unidirectional. Direction is deeply fundamental to vectors but our channels are symmetric except for the one case of deposits. If we're trying to be mathematically accurate, we should probably call it `edge` but honestly I like the `spacefold`, `wormhole`, `timewarp` aesthetic :nerd: (I think worm holes are a legit analogy for channels too)
 - Calling the funds holder a `Multisig` seems silly, it's so much more than yet another boring multisig wallet. I think it's a leftover artifact from cf, how they tried to make their system privacy preserving bc vanilla chain explorers can't tell whether the contract is a state channels wallet or a normal multisig. (1) this doesn't really matter (2) especially bc disputing on-chain breaks privacy regardless. Let's skip the foreplay & call it what it is: a `VectorChannel`
